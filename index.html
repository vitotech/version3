											<h2>Metal Stamping Dies</h2>
											<p>VITO provides turnkey tool services, from concept development through tool completion, using advanced technology and systems. Tool &amp; Die designs, tests and manufactures metal stamping dies using innovative, cost-effective engineering solutions for medium to large complex tooling systems. Our manufacturing capabilities include the production of <span style="color: #ff0000;">progressive dies, transfer dies, line dies and more</span>. Custom stamping dies can be created for various applications in industries such as automotive and aerospace.</p>
											<p>* <span style="color: #ff0000;">Progressive Dies</span> are used in higher-volume production and are designed to operate at high rates of speed, Several different processes may be incorporated within a single die, for example: blanking, bending, punching, piercing, tapping, embossing, curling, knurling, and deep drawing.<br>
											* <span style="color: #ff0000;">Transfer Dies</span> are used in high-volume manufacturing for round, deep-drawn, and medium-to-large parts.<br>
											* <span style="color: #ff0000;">Line Dies</span> are used for low-volume parts and to manufacture large parts that cannot be efficiently manufactured in one press.<br>
											* <span style="color: #ff0000;">Die Repair</span> - VITO provides expert repair, revision and maintenance for metal stamping tooling systems. We can repair tooling as needed -- preventing lost-part production, non-value-added secondary operations and late-parts delivery. Any of these conditions waste valuable resources and raise part costs.</p>
